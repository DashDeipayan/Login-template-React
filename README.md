# A Login template project on ReactJS

In this project, I'm implementing a login form which included email and password as basic inputs along side OTP verification and referral code input section. This project can be utilised as template for login and authentication purposes(Atleast that is the goal for me HAHAHAHA!!)

This project is where is will be using

- React as the primary library
- Jest for UI Integration testing
- React router for routing
- (Probably) Some bootstrap for styling(Probably!!!!!!)
